bind 0.3.5
==========

* improve performance of calc.enrich()

bingd 0.3.4
===========

* Require AnnotationHub v1.6.0
* Replace plyr with dplyr


bingd 0.3.3.3
=============

* Require AnnotationHub v1.4.0

bingd 0.3.3.2
=============

* export consolidate()
* calc.conditionals() reports feature probabilities when verbose = TRUE

bingd 0.3.3.1
=============

* export S4 methods

bingd 0.3.3
===========

* risk.threshold() is now a calc.threshold() and adds a verbose option 
* add option to supply prob.risk in  calc.bayes() 

* overlapsAny() is now findOverlaps(), which returns HitsList or integer vectors
  to be consistent with with the IRanges package
* the new featureOverlaps() function is the exported version of findOverlaps(),
  which returns a logical vector for each feature, nested within an list that
  mirrors the structure of the supplied FeatureList object

* removed unused fix_chrs() and order_chrs() code
* removed rtracklayer and GenomicFeatures as dependencies
* removed reshape2 dependency

* documentation improvements, switched to roxygen2 4.0

bingd 0.3.2
===========

* AnnotatedGWAS class now an extension of the GWAS class
* calc.pr() is now calc.priors()
* calc.priors() works with GWAS as well as AnnotatedGWAS objects
* label.groups() is about 4x faster now


bingd 0.3.1
===========

* Add zscore as an optional argument when constructing a GWAS object

* load.feature() checks loaded object class is GRanges

* Add verbose option to calc.bayes
* Add S3 reporter functions for verbose option
* calc.pr() and calc.conditionals() results are now S3 objects

* A p-value risk threshold is now calculated if one isn't provided

bingd 0.3.0
===========

Major changes
-------------

Adds initial implementation of Bayesian algorithm:

* Adds consolidate() function to reduce features within groups
* Adds calc.pr()
* Adds calc.conditionals()
  
Minor changes
-------------

* Adds tests for features() and fcols()
* Adds tests for consolidate()
* feature.labels() now just strips file extension from basename
* Adds summary method for AnnotatedGWAS objects

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixes bug in consolidate() causing feature names to be lost
* Fixes bug in local.features() causing it to fail when searched directories
  contained only one file

bingd 0.2.4
===========

* Implements S4 AnnotatedGWAS class
* Adds features() and fcols() accesors for AnnotatedGWAS objects
* pull.features() is deprecated
* Adds pvalue() and marker() accessors for GWAS objects


bingd 0.2.3.2
=============

* Export as.GWAS()
* Fix bug in z-score calculations

bingd 0.2.3.1
=============

* Bump version number

bingd 0.2.3
==========

* Major improvements to documentation
* Deprecated import.gwas()
* Implements S4 FeatureList class
* GWAS objects now require genome build information

bingd 0.2.2
===========

* Implements S4 GWAS class
* Updated methods to work with new class
* Adds tests for:
    - creating GWAS objects
    - adding annotations
    - calculating enrichment

bingd 0.2.1
===========

* Feature search

  * Local features independent of AnnotationHub can now be searched for using
    `local.features()`
  * Searching AnnotationHub is now done using `hub.features()`, to be consistent
    with `local.features()` and `hub.metadata()` is deprecated

* Uncached AnnotationHub features can be downloaded using cache.features()

bingd 0.2
=========

* Feature search

  * Searching is now decoupled from annotating and calculating enrichment
	* Searching for AnnotationHub features can now be
	  conducted without an internet connection by setting
	  `online = FALSE`
	* `get.metadata()` is now `hub.metadata()`
	* `feature.search()` is now `hub.search()`
  * returns a FeatureList object

* `annotate.gwas()` now requires a FeatureList object and no longer requires
   an internet connection  
* `calc.enrichment()` can be performed with an annotated GWAS object OR
   with an unannotated GWAS object + a FeatureList object

* `features()` is now `pull.features()`, an S4 function

* ADDED unit tests
